# journey_into_computer_vision

This is a repository of my journey into the exciting field of computer vision. I start this journey, with taking my first course from the youtube channel "Joseph Redmon" playlist named "Ancient secrets of computer vision". Slides are available in the following link: https://pjreddie.com/courses/computer-vision/ . I do not own any of the material and all are owned by the author of the course.
